## genome_skittle
The purpose of this app was to convert skittleToo http://github.com/mrgenixus/skittle to a library that could be included into another application.

> # Skittle
> Skittle is the name of a genome-browser tool whose purpose is to make empirical patterns in genome base-pairs visually obvious.  The fundamental fucntionality shows ACGT base pair bytes from standard genome encoding text files as, each, an individual color and supports pattern-exposing transforms to them.  The ultimate purpose was to expose informational content in genome structure which might give us the ability to distill genetic information to a vocabulary, and begin to treat it as a language from which new viable genes might be written.

### Status.
Defunct. I am unable to finish this project without participation from a bioinformatics domain expert (which I am not).
